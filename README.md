# Random-Password-Generator


## Description
This is a random password generator based on selected criteria by the user. Users will be prompt to choose options for their password (i.e. password length) and the password must contain at least 1 Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric and Special characters.  The app was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.



## JavaScript

I used HTML, CSS and JS to create an app that:

1) Generates a password when the button is clicked
2) Presents a series of prompts for password criteria including:
    * Length of password
      * ensuring at least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase 1
      * Uppercase 1
      * Numeric 1
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc) 1
3) Validates each input and ensures at least one character type is selected
4) Once prompts are answered, the password is then generated and displayed to the page
